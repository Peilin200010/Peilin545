all code is in w6solutions.ipynb
note that I used my own risk management library, so you need to install it first.
1. to run it, use pycharm
2. click "python package" at the bottom, choose add package from disk, 
then choose your path of "risk_mgt_lib" to add. (in Week05 direcotory)
(warning: must choose the whole library directory)
3. when Pycharm says: "riskill installed", you can run the code in ipynb.
